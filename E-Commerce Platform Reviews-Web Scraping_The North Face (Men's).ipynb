As other have mentioned this is not a jacket to keep you warm rather it is to keep you dry and protect you from the wind chill. I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased. I have not used it yet but supposed to get some rain in the coming days so we will see how it works and I will update this review.

It doesn't keep out the cold, but is light enough to layer up underneath. The hood is great. Zipper perfect. I like the cuff Velcro which helps change the size of the cuffs.

Definitely the best thing to do is to go to a store and try first. However if you like to buy online conveniently, here is the straight answer about sizing. TNF Denali jackets sizes absolutely go larger than your then your regular size. Here is the reason. I usually wear either medium or large. However after seeing the reviews about size questioning, maybe first time i measured my size at home. I am 5\\'7\" around 155-160lb and my chest is 41\". I checked northface website, i was saying 36-38\" small & 39-41\" medium. At first I thought medium would be snug fit. later i watched a youtube wideo a 5\\'9\" guy was wearing medium and it was even little loose. So I chose small. Right decision. Even my chest at upper margin of medium size, small was still slightly larger. If I had chose medium, probably it would like wearing my big brothers jacket.\\n\\nLong story short, the north face denali goes larger than your regular size.',\n",

For my purposes (everyday wind breaker with light rain protection) Venture 2 with Dryvent is worse in every way. Venture 2 manages to be too hot and too cold at the same time. It's stiff and makes crinkling noises when you move. And it has a very strange fit. It's like wearing a crinkly plastic bag. With Venture 2 when you first step outside you are way too cold, because the jacket has zero insulation. But if you exert yourself at all it quickly gets hot and humid inside. I don't understand how you could take such a comfortable, breathable jacket and screw it up so badly. Perhaps Venture 2 is better in a complete downpour?\",\n",

As other have mentioned this is not a jacket to keep you warm rather it is to keep you dry and protect you from the wind chill. I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased. I have not used it yet but supposed to get some rain in the coming days so we will see how it works and I will update this review.

Not Sure how it will do in major down pours, we don't get many of those, or hours on end of rain. But for the light steady rain of the Northwest this jacket is great. It doesn't keep out the cold, but is light enough to layer up underneath. The hood is great. Zipper perfect. I like the cuff Velcro which helps change the size of the cuffs.

Definitely the best thing to do is to go to a store and try first. However if you like to buy online conveniently, here is the straight answer about sizing. TNF Denali jackets sizes absolutely go larger than your then your regular size. Here is the reason. I usually wear either medium or large. However after seeing the reviews about size questioning, maybe first time i measured my size at home. I am 5\\'7\" around 155-160lb and my chest is 41\". I checked northface website, i was saying 36-38\" small & 39-41\" medium. At first I thought medium would be snug fit. later i watched a youtube wideo a 5\\'9\" guy was wearing medium and it was even little loose. So I chose small. Right decision. Even my chest at upper margin of medium size, small was still slightly larger. If I had chose medium, probably it would like wearing my big brothers jacket.\\n\\nLong story short, the north face denali goes larger than your regular size.',\n",

For my purposes (everyday wind breaker with light rain protection) Venture 2 with Dryvent is worse in every way. Venture 2 manages to be too hot and too cold at the same time. It's stiff and makes crinkling noises when you move. And it has a very strange fit. It's like wearing a crinkly plastic bag. With Venture 2 when you first step outside you are way too cold, because the jacket has zero insulation. But if you exert yourself at all it quickly gets hot and humid inside. I don't understand how you could take such a comfortable, breathable jacket and screw it up so badly. Perhaps Venture 2 is better in a complete downpour?\",\n",

As other have mentioned this is not a jacket to keep you warm rather it is to keep you dry and protect you from the wind chill. I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased. I have not used it yet but supposed to get some rain in the coming days so we will see how it works and I will update this review.

Definitely the best thing to do is to go to a store and try first. However if you like to buy online conveniently, here is the straight answer about sizing. TNF Denali jackets sizes absolutely go larger than your then your regular size. Here is the reason. I usually wear either medium or large. However after seeing the reviews about size questioning, maybe first time i measured my size at home. I am 5\\'7\" around 155-160lb and my chest is 41\". I checked northface website, i was saying 36-38\" small & 39-41\" medium. At first I thought medium would be snug fit. later i watched a youtube wideo a 5\\'9\" guy was wearing medium and it was even little loose. So I chose small. Right decision. Even my chest at upper margin of medium size, small was still slightly larger. If I had chose medium, probably it would like wearing my big brothers jacket.\\n\\nLong story short, the north face denali goes larger than your regular size.',\n",
       "   \"I had the original Venture jacket with Hyvent construction that I wore happily for 15 years. For my purposes (everyday wind breaker with light rain protection) Venture 2 with Dryvent is worse in every way. Venture 2 manages to be too hot and too cold at the same time. It's stiff and makes crinkling noises when you move. And it has a very strange fit. It's like wearing a crinkly plastic bag. With Venture 2 when you first step outside you are way too cold, because the jacket has zero insulation. But if you exert yourself at all it quickly gets hot and humid inside. I don't understand how you could take such a comfortable, breathable jacket and screw it up so badly. Perhaps Venture 2 is better in a complete downpour?\",\n",

Not better, just a different feel and finish. I personally like the thicker feel of the 70d.\\n\\nI also want to note that this jacket runs a little big.

       "   \"I purchased this jacket prior to a trip to southern Chile. I wanted a softshell jacket that would keep the elements out and remains breathable while I go hiking around Patagonia. This jacket is not suitable for that purpose.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I really like this jacket. It is a great looking jacket. It fits well. Very warm and cozy. The wind in Southern Patagonia was up to 100 km/hr, and this jacket (on top of a base layer) kept the wind out and kept me warm while walking around town playing tourist. When I actually engaged in moderately strenuous activities like hiking through the hills and mountains of Chile, however, this jacket is not breathable enough and soon I was sweating in the inside, despite having only one base layer underneath. My phone which I often leave in the left pocket would be wet with condensed moisture inside the jacket. It also proved to be heavy and cumbersome to carry as part of a layering system.\\n\\nIn short, the North Face Apex Bionic Softshell Jacket is a warm, comfortable, and stylish jacket to wear around town. I wear it regularly in cooler weather while traveling to work and running errands. It's very nice for a stroll through the park or sitting in a bar drinking beer. It's a nice jacket to wear at the office to let people know that you like the idea of the North Face and the idea of the outdoors and that on the weekend you think that you could climb a mountain. But for actual outdoor activities like climbing a mountain... this jacket is silly. It's too heavy and doesn't breath well enough. If there is exercise induced tachycardia and/or bears involved, leave this jacket at home and wear something that's actually made for the outdoors.\",\n",

I normally wear a Medium to a Large depending on the brand, (im 5'8, 135lbs with really long arms) and from the reviews I saw this ran a bit small so I ordered a Large. Id say it fits perfect, still w/ a bit of room to spare for thicker clothes underneath. My only complaint was the shipping method, I said it was coming Fedex, only to be tranferred off to the local post office (which I dont prefer due to limited delivery hours and sometimes they leavea tag and make you drive there to pick it up and I often cant make it before they close), not sure if Amazon or this company has any control over that or not, I would think so, but...\",\n",

       "   'This jacket looks amazing and has a lot of great features without being gaudy. I am 5\\'9\" and 150 lbs with a lean build, and I ordered the medium. However, compared to my medium Patagonia soft shell, the fit on the Apex Bionic is a bit too \"relaxed,\" with a lot of room around the torso. Given, this problem was reduced after the first wash and dry, but it\\'s still not very fitted. (I guess I could\\'ve ordered an active fit Jacket from North Face, but those look like they\\'re meant for jogging and not general, daily use.)\\n\\nDespite the fitting issue, this jacket comfortably accommodates a medium North Face fleece layer underneath, although I wish loops existed in the wrists to lock the tabs in. By itself, the jacket is warm and blocks the wind, and I would not hesitate to bring it on a backpacking trip. Overall, +4 stars for the stylish look and functionality.',\n",
       "   \"Nice lite jacket for the spring/fall. Only thing I dislike about this jacket is the inner lining is a material that literally sticks to everything. They should have lined the jacket with a smooth shell. XXL fits well, runs true to size. I'm 6 foot even, 240lbs, athletic build.\",\n",

       "   'This jacket looks amazing and has a lot of great features without being gaudy. I am 5\\'9\" and 150 lbs with a lean build, and I ordered the medium. However, compared to my medium Patagonia soft shell, the fit on the Apex Bionic is a bit too \"relaxed,\" with a lot of room around the torso. Given, this problem was reduced after the first wash and dry, but it\\'s still not very fitted. (I guess I could\\'ve ordered an active fit Jacket from North Face, but those look like they\\'re meant for jogging and not general, daily use.)\\n\\nDespite the fitting issue, this jacket comfortably accommodates a medium North Face fleece layer underneath, although I wish loops existed in the wrists to lock the tabs in. By itself, the jacket is warm and blocks the wind, and I would not hesitate to bring it on a backpacking trip. Overall, +4 stars for the stylish look and functionality.',\n",

If you left jean jackets back in the 80\\'s with Bon Jovi Concerts, than I would advise you to pick another color.',\n",

As soon as he pulled it out of the package, he was beaming from ear to ear. He put it on and didn't take it off until of course it made him way too hot. This is now his most favorite jacket. Best of all he says dog hair doesn't stick to it at all!\",\n",
       "   'So, I am in no way an expert at spotting fakes, but this has been my favorite jacket for a few years now, and I own 3. I received my jacket from \"right-price\", and I should have paid more attention that it was not coming from Amazon proper. I bought the jacket to replace a color I had recently lost. The jacket showed up shoved (not folded) in a bag stamped \"ready to ship.\" The jacket had no tags on it whatsoever, and felt considerably lighter than the other two I had. The material was thinner. I put the jacket on, and it was cut way too wide in the back, and felt nothing like the fit of the other two I have. I was surprised, having paid the full $159, that i would receive a possible fake. I ended up doing some research, and ended up purchasing from the actual TNF website (why not, I was paying full price). The second I touched the material and felt the weight of the jacket I knew I was right, and returned the \"right-price\" jacket. This is not a knock on Amazon, they are still by far my favorite online retailer...just a word of caution to potential buyers...if you have never had one of these jackets, it is worth your time to actually feel what a real one feels like (at a store or a friends jacket) before you purchase online.',\n",

I would have liked to get one with the same material and fabric but I'm not sure if it's been discontinued? I'll be going out to the mall to see if I can find a better fit.

It is made of a durable fabric and has a nice size chest pocket so this is a formidable hiking jacket. The only gripe I have with it is the collar. The front of the collar is stiff and even when not fully zipped up, it stands up and rubs on my chin. My scruff catches it like velcro and has begun fraying the soft fabric on the inside of the collar. I find myself constantly trying to avoid rubbing it by looking up to go over the collar. It gets annoying. I've tried folding the collar down to make it stand out to the side but it doesn't work because it's mainly the zipper that is to blame for it standing up. I wish TNF would fix this. The heat transfer logos worried me but it's a little thicker than the ones they're putting on their stuff these days, which are like paper. I personally would prefer an embroidered logo for the price of these jackets. I feel like it's only a matter of time before the heat sealed logo starts to come off\",\n",
       "   \"Was a hit as a Birthday present for my bf. He's always wanted one of these jackets. I've watched him window shop this thing for too long. Lol I was nervous about buying online b/c of sz & possible fakes. Idk the difference if it was fake but its nicely made & seems like the real deal to me. Thinking about buying one for my son for Christmas so yes I'd buy from this seller again. :) Bought my bf a L. He's 6ft & around 200lbs. Fit him nicely. My 14yr old son who is 5'8 & 165lbs it was a bit too big when he tried it on. Thinking he'll need a medium. Hope this helps somebody. Thanks for the jacket & fast shipping. We love it.\",\n",

Zero North Face clothing fits anymore, especially these jackets. In the past I have loved my NF gear, but lately the cut is terrible. The sleeves are too short, the torso too short, and way to much material in the body. Under the arms it bunches up. The bottom edge lets in wind, and if you use the drawstring to tighten up, its like a big puffball in the chest The whole jacket, it\\'s like a big boxy square. It\\'s 2015 NF, wake up. I tried the XL and XXL. The XXL was just massive in the body, with proper sleeve length for me though. I think I have a fairly common body type. More common than say, someone my height who is 300lbs, which is who the XXL will fit. The XL would fit someone like 6\" and 250lbs. Who do you think is buying this outdoor/activity gear, North Face? Mr. Couch Potato? Unless they make some drastic fit changes in the next year\\'s rollout, I am done with this company. It has all the feel of sellout company to me at this point, like they aren\\'t even trying.',\n",

While that was great, it was their post-purchase customer service that I was very impressed by. Shortly after it arrived I received an email asking if my item was delivered and if everything was satisfactory with the item I bought. It’s a small thing, but it’s the thing that tells me they care about their e-commerce customers and will be the reason I buy from them again.\\nThe North Face TKA Snap-Neck Pullover is another great item from this company. It’s well made with quality fleece and what appear to be heavy duty snaps embossed with “The North Face”. I’m a 6’1” 253lb man that ordered an XXL and it fits perfectly both in width and length. Because it’s fleece I expect it to shrink in the wash a little, but I ordered it with that in mind already as you should do too. The color was true to the advertised picture and the fleece material is softer than other items I’ve purchased of theirs. Ultimately it’s a really comfortable and warm piece, perfect for those Upstate NY fall days.',\n",

       "   'This item is very similar to the \"Columbia Men\\'s Park View Fleece Full Zip\". I eventually ended-up buying one of each: one Columbia and one North Face Canyonlands Full-Zip. Both are excellent products but they are slightly different:\\n- The North Face Canyonlands is a little bit thicker and warmer than the columbia (just a little bit). The columbia is more of a mid-season product that could even be used in a cold summer day/morning. The Northface is more of a \"wintry season\" product, I imagine I would sweat inside the car when driving while using it.\\n- Hands down, the North Face has a better fit, say a \"contoured fit\" that follows the lines of your body. The Columbia has a good fit too, but it feels slightly baggy.\\n- The columbia has the thumb whole in the sleeve. Even though the columbia feels slightly baggy (it\\'s not), it is actually more comfortable for hiking/jogging than the North Face. You want your clothes to feel packed to your torso and arms, and want to avoid relative movement of your sleeves with respect to your arms when hiking. Let\\'s simply say: the columbia is more \"sporty or fitness-oriented\" than the northface.\\n\\nI hope this helps take a decision.\\n\\nBest,',\n",

And no being from ny and visiting does not make me adjust to the cold at all. My feet have been struggling. I started to assume I had a medical condition or something because my feet were cold all day. My feet were cold from walking from the parking lot to the hospital. Then cold all day at work. Waking 30min my toes were becoming numb and it didn’t matter what I had on. Warm winter wool sock didn’t work and I was becoming worried. Well after finally coming to a realization that my new balance were just not warm enough and maybe waking into work with them and using them for the hospital as well was just not working I looked for other alternatives and thank goodness I did. Wearing this to work only has saved my feet. I am no longer having cold feet all day. For walks inserts will be needed! But rain, snow and wind I have had no issues. I have had my feet like slide in the rain once but never was it close to falling or sliding it just made the noise so I just walk with caution when I see water. Have not had to walk in snow because I did not have these yet. I am an 8 1/2 and listen to sizing up and a 9 was to big for me so my size 8 was best yes I ordered two sizes and returned one. My co workers have also purchased after seeing mine . I love them so much',\n",

These worked out so well that I would have gladly paid the full more expensive price in a better color such as dark blue to go with jeans.\\n\\nI tried a few other bootie slippers from other brands. They were comfortable due to the foam padding. And they were soft inside due to a fake fur lining, but NOT warm overall; the soles of them fell apart in short order and often smelled awful. Hands down -- the North Face beat these out by a landslide. My only regret now is having camouflage instead of dark blue booties. But hey, first-world problems, right?',\n",

And no being from ny and visiting does not make me adjust to the cold at all. My feet have been struggling. I started to assume I had a medical condition or something because my feet were cold all day. My feet were cold from walking from the parking lot to the hospital. Then cold all day at work. Waking 30min my toes were becoming numb and it didn’t matter what I had on. Warm winter wool sock didn’t work and I was becoming worried. Well after finally coming to a realization that my new balance were just not warm enough and maybe waking into work with them and using them for the hospital as well was just not working I looked for other alternatives and thank goodness I did. Wearing this to work only has saved my feet. I am no longer having cold feet all day. For walks inserts will be needed! But rain, snow and wind I have had no issues. I have had my feet like slide in the rain once but never was it close to falling or sliding it just made the noise so I just walk with caution when I see water. Have not had to walk in snow because I did not have these yet. I am an 8 1/2 and listen to sizing up and a 9 was to big for me so my size 8 was best yes I ordered two sizes and returned one. My co workers have also purchased after seeing mine . I love them so much',\n",

They were comfortable due to the foam padding. And they were soft inside due to a fake fur lining, but NOT warm overall; the soles of them fell apart in short order and often smelled awful.

There's a thin rubber sole on the bottom with good grip, and where the sole meets the upper there's a very sturdy feeling rubberized connector. You could definitely wear these shoes on short errands or to get the mail. The fit is true to size in my opinion.

There's a thin rubber sole on the bottom with good grip, and where the sole meets the upper there's a very sturdy feeling rubberized connector. You could definitely wear these shoes on short errands or to get the mail. The fit is true to size in my opinion. I have a 10.5 foot and the size 10 is just a little snug, but the heel stretches back a bit so it is a comfortable fit with zero looseness.\",\n",

Definitely the best camp shoe, warm,memory foam feeling, with a sole that's like tennis shoes. No problem walking around camps with sticks or Rocky surface.\",\n",

       "   'While the color is very attractive and they are soft, but I am disappointed pointed with how they fit compared to the traction mule 4’s. I’m also dissatisfied with the way the outer stitching appears compared to the 4’s. The way the 4’s are stitched bends more naturally with the foot. These bend with a more “blocky, bulky” like feel. I LOVE the Thermoball Traction Mule 4’s (they are the black pair with grey triangles in my photo), but these are the Traction Mule 5’s (the grey pair in the photo). I was excited as I thought the 5’s would be a newer version of the 4’s. Yet the 5’s are pointier, more narrow and are much tighter around the ankle than the 5’s. And this is coming from someone with a relatively small and average width foot. I bought size 8 and while the length is good, they are pointy and narrow so purchasing a 9 would make them too long for my foot. All in all they are less attractive due to the pointiness and more importantly, less comfortable than I had expected. I’m very disappointed as the traction mule 4’s were my favorite slipper. I bought three of the 4’s I loved them so much. This will be the only pair of the 5’s I buy. Honestly, I don’t see how some sellers can get away with charging over one hundred dollars... The comfort level of these I would value around $25 or maybe $30, an average sturdy house slipper that can be worn outside, at school or while around the campground.',\n",

       "   'As someone with what my wife calls \"hobbit feet,\" I usually look for extra-wide footwear, which is tough for slippers since I rarely see them offered in anything but regular/medium width.\\n\\nI tried these out because I wanted something I could put on for walking the dog or taking out the trash in wet weather. (I won\\'t pretend I got these for rock climbing!) My shoe size is 8.5, and I originally bought these in size 9.\\n\\nI was surprised by how comfortable these were on my hobbit feet. The durable-but-flexible material has a decent amount of give, so they feel fine even though they\\'re a bit narrow. The soles are grippy, and although at first they felt too thin, I quickly realized that this is actually a plus—the flexibility gives your feet more \"feedback\" when walking on rough or uneven surfaces, so I find I\\'m not stumbling when I accidentally step on a rock or a large crack in the pavement.\\n\\nThe problem comes when I wear these with socks. They already take some effort to put on—these are definitely not made to easily slip on, but rather encase your foot, which helps with warmth and stability, since they feel snug and secure. But with even thin socks on, the size 9s felt uncomfortably tight.\\n\\nI ordered size 10s, and that seems to be the solution for me. As an 8.5, I never wear size 10 since they\\'re comically large on my feet, but these are probably more comparable to a 9.5. With this size, plus socks, they\\'re perfect. Without socks, they do feel a bit loose. But since I\\'d almost always wear these with socks, that\\'s fine.\\n\\nSo, it took a little fine-tuning, but the effort was worth it. For what I\\'m using them for, to keep my feet warm around the house and to walk around outside without worrying about soaking my feet in water puddles or slipping or stumbling on wet/uneven surfaces, they\\'re the best slippers I\\'ve tried so far.',\n",

I submit the picture of the soles as proof. However these shoes/boots are not indicative of what I have come to expect from the North Face which professes to be a maker of sturdy out door wear. I am a retired infantryman and I know my hiking boots. I however have not even used these to hike as I have my old pair which are low cut for that, I purchased these because when I retire my old ines and buy another , I wanted more ankle support. What you see in picture of the top is a result of just walking. Normal wear nothing extraneous as this is my “nice pair” for outings. The Mesh or webbing or whatever it is on the tops of both toe areas is disintegrating. I have spilled nothing on them nor put them in a washing machine or subjected them to high heat. They have not been snagged on anything like vegitation, the mesh is just coming apart like paper. This is just from normal flexing of my feet as I walk. I havent even run in them. I am truly disappointed in the product and this is a shame as they were my new favorite type to buy with the great comfort level and I love Vibram soles.',\n",

The reduced number of eyelets makes the boot feel real loose, no matter how tight you think you have it. The material that covers the toe area on top was also reduced. The boot is now more expensive with less material creating a bad fit. What a shame as I know North Face will do nothing about this (insert super long rant here).',\n",

They do the job, and I can wear them at work, as the black and gray ones are pretty muted. They are comfortable enough to wear all day. These were a good purchase.\",\n",

The inside liner in the heels started wearing out very soon after I got them and they got small tears at the flex points in the front. They were 11 1/2's (my normal size) but they were a little bit tight. I don't usually have trouble with shoes fitting and as I don't wear them very often it wasn't that big a deal. I said I would not have another pair of North Face - but guess what, I do. I tried a pair of Merrills but had to return them because the fit was just not right for my foot. This time, I bought both an 11 1/2 and a 12 in the Ultra 111 to see which one was better. I wish I could say one of them was perfect but I must be in between because the 11 1/2 was slight short again and the 12 is just a little large. Either would have been vastly better than the Merrills so I am keeping the 12's. I have worn them a few times to break them in and so far I like them. Too early to tell whether theses will wear any better than the 109's did (not betting on it) so I am keeping the review at 3 stars.\",\n",

The waterproofing material also changed from Gortex to their own proprietary material. Seems to make no difference. Probably just cost saving on their part. Out if the box the 111 had no comfort issues. I remember the old 110 had a issue at the toe box for me for a few weeks until it broke in. It was the extra protruding material where the tongue meets the toe box. Good thing the 111 did not have the same issue. I’ve wore Salomen and La Sportiva trail runners. Those two other brands have better design properties but were narrow for me. The NorthFace 111 had the best fit for me. I will definitely buy again.',\n",

Over time it kept getting worse in both shoes.\\n\\nI attempted on multiple occasions to free the sand from the shoes, but ultimately I had to cut a slice into the liner of the shoes so that I could get the sand out of the shoes.

I usually wear a 9 in flops and ordered a 9 here. My feet slid in ok but there are a couple things that threw me off that ultimately made me return them. First the strap/thong part was super soft and comfortable BUT it was too stretchy so there was a lot of play when I walked. Secondly was the compound used for the sole - it's very soft and slippery. I would question it's long term durability especially given the awkwardness of the fit. Obviously there are lots of good reviews here and this was just my opinion. These are probably good for recovery bc they are so soft but I wear flops year round so not a good match for me. I went back to the much firmer and more durable REEF compound (Fanning and Phantom).\",\n",

There's were a weird light but very dull grey that didn't really match the pictures. I couldn't decide if I liked that or not because I couldn't get past the fit and feel. I usually wear a 9 in flops and ordered a 9 here. My feet slid in ok but there are a couple things that threw me off that ultimately made me return them. First the strap/thong part was super soft and comfortable BUT it was too stretchy so there was a lot of play when I walked. Secondly was the compound used for the sole - it's very soft and slippery. I would question it's long term durability especially given the awkwardness of the fit. Obviously there are lots of good reviews here and this was just my opinion. These are probably good for recovery bc they are so soft but I wear flops year round so not a good match for me. I went back to the much firmer and more durable REEF compound (Fanning and Phantom).\",\n",

The cheaper material they use for the souls wears out and also leaves a black residue on bottom of feet that scrubbing is needed to remove. Its upsetting that the last ones i bought lasted 5 years plus of constant wear and did not leave any residue on my feet. These new ones already look older than my 5 year old pair. Very disappointed and also hope that whatever the mysterious black residue left on my feet is not carcinogenic from the plastic/rubber used for the sandal',\n",

I only have on TNF item, an older pair of pants from their Summit Series which has held up well and delivered, but I stay away from TNF because it's just become a logo for a lot of people and I don't think their stuff is 'gear-oriented' any more. That said, I liked the look of the Salty Dog Beanie, and how it was made, so I took a shot. I did get the previous year version which has a very small, indiscreet logo. A departure from TNF and one I liked. Seems like they're out now. A drag because I REALLY like the beanie and wanted to buy another. But not for 45 bucks.\\n\\nWhen I first got it I almost thought they sent me a kids version. There's an inner lining that made it feel so tight that I almost returned it. But I gave it a few days of pretty constant wearing and I ended up with a perfect fit. It's cuffed but the lining doesn't prohibit how thick or thin you can cuff. You could also wear it uncuffed if you want something more towards the slouchy.\\n\\nI find it to be really well-made and delivers solid warmth. Just standing around in the teens with it has kept my head warm. Where there are some limitations is with hiking. I think that's really dependent on weather and how much someone sweats. The lining is a thin cotton but that means it'll hold sweat and that turns in to cold. The coldest I've hiked with it, because I wanted to check it out, was in the mid 20's and the sweat did become a little problematic. So this won't be my choice if it's cold and I'm working. But in warmer temps, or colder if you're not active, this is surprisingly solid choice. It is pilling a bit but I think it actually looks a little better with some wear.\\n\\nNow I need to find an outlet that has the older model. There's some other TNF stuff I'd consider but I'll never be a walking billboard for a company. TNF decided to move from gear to lifestyle. Their choice but I don't know too many dirt bags, other than Alex Honnold who is a paid athlete, who would go with them as a first choice. But they DID nail this beanie.\",\n",

       "   'I wanted something thin for walking in 0-10° temperatures in Toronto. I looked at others and figured The North Face was a good brand. But I find myself always putting my hands in my pockets to stay warm, even while wearing these gloves.\\n\\nStrangely, I think that wearing these gloves are making my hands colder: knowing I’m wearing gloves, I become less conscious of keeping my hands in my pocket. But after about 30 minutes, the gloves are cold and so are my hands. So then I have to take the gloves off to warm my hands next to my own body heat.\\n\\nI’m not sure what temperature they’re made for. They probably work great in +30° weather though.',\n",

As other have mentioned this is not a jacket to keep you warm rather it is to keep you dry and protect you from the wind chill. I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased. I have not used it yet but supposed to get some rain in the coming days so we will see how it works and I will update this review.

Not Sure how it will do in major down pours, we don't get many of those, or hours on end of rain. But for the light steady rain of the Northwest this jacket is great. It doesn't keep out the cold, but is light enough to layer up underneath. The hood is great. Zipper perfect. I like the cuff Velcro which helps change the size of the cuffs. The slate gray color is sharp and looks good. Overall great jacket for moderate temps and weather of the rainy Northwest, so you never will use an Umbrella!\",\n",

With COVID going on, I won\\'t bother exchanging....So the jacket is a little big, but still looks good. Has arm pit vents, and 2x zippered outside pockets form 2x useable deep inner jacket pockets.

I am 5\\'9\" of athletic body, sitting at 160lbs, (39\"/ 99cm Chest) and the XS fit me just a little too big for my own liking, but it deserves the five stars, as it accomplishes what it is meant to do, and will allow you to layer underneath. It works real well against the wind; nothing gets through. There are zippers on the side on both armpits, and the hood has good coverage and allows me to wear my over-the-ear headphones(Sennheiser\\'s HD 4.50).',\n",

TNF Denali jackets sizes absolutely go larger than your then your regular size. Here is the reason. I usually wear either medium or large. However after seeing the reviews about size questioning, maybe first time i measured my size at home. I am 5\\'7\" around 155-160lb and my chest is 41\". I checked northface website, i was saying 36-38\" small & 39-41\" medium. At first I thought medium would be snug fit. later i watched a youtube wideo a 5\\'9\" guy was wearing medium and it was even little loose. So I chose small. Right decision. Even my chest at upper margin of medium size, small was still slightly larger. If I had chose medium, probably it would like wearing my big brothers jacket.\\n\\nLong story short, the north face denali goes larger than your regular size.',\n",

It's stiff and makes crinkling noises when you move. And it has a very strange fit. It's like wearing a crinkly plastic bag. With Venture 2 when you first step outside you are way too cold, because the jacket has zero insulation. But if you exert yourself at all it quickly gets hot and humid inside. I don't understand how you could take such a comfortable, breathable jacket and screw it up so badly. Perhaps Venture 2 is better in a complete downpour?\",\n",

Habrá gente que encuentre a faltar una capucha, otra que es demasiado ligera. Pero excepto los que se vean expuestos a temperaturas extremas, no necesitarán más. Y si fuera así, es suficientemente ligera como para ir debajo de un anorak, en mejores condiciones que un polar. Aquí, incluso con sólo una camiseta o camisa debajo, es suficiente. Aunque vivo en Girona (No es Teruel, pero tampoco Barcelona y mucho menos otras ciudades españolas) he sudado mucho. Con un jersey, ni te cuento.

I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior. Anyways the interior color is a minor thing but Amazon should update the picture to represent what was actually being purchased.

Rain is no match for this jacket. Not Sure how it will do in major down pours, we don't get many of those, or hours on end of rain. But for the light steady rain of the Northwest this jacket is great. It doesn't keep out the cold, but is light enough to layer up underneath. The hood is great. Zipper perfect.

I am 5\\'9\" of athletic body, sitting at 160lbs, (39\"/ 99cm Chest) and the XS fit me just a little too big for my own liking, but it deserves the five stars, as it accomplishes what it is meant to do, and will allow you to layer underneath.

However, the hood is inadequate. It just sits on top of my head and does not extend to protect my face from the rain. I am totally puzzled why they would make the product this way--perhaps because it looks better? When I'm riding in a rain storm, I don't care about how the hood looks, I just want it to work well!

Before I made a purchase i did alot of research about the right size. Finally I made a decision and ordered small. Definitely the best thing to do is to go to a store and try first. However if you like to buy online conveniently, here is the straight answer about sizing. TNF Denali jackets sizes absolutely go larger than your then your regular size. Here is the reason. I usually wear either medium or large. However after seeing the reviews about size questioning, maybe first time i measured my size at home. I am 5\\'7\" around 155-160lb and my chest is 41\". I checked northface website, i was saying 36-38\" small & 39-41\" medium. At first I thought medium would be snug fit. later i watched a youtube wideo a 5\\'9\" guy was wearing medium and it was even little loose. So I chose small. Right decision. Even my chest at upper margin of medium size, small was still slightly larger. If I had chose medium, probably it would like wearing my big brothers jacket.\\n\\nLong story short, the north face denali goes larger than your regular size.', \"I had the original Venture jacket with Hyvent construction that I wore happily for 15 years. For my purposes (everyday wind breaker with light rain protection) Venture 2 with Dryvent is worse in every way. Venture 2 manages to be too hot and too cold at the same time. It's stiff and makes crinkling noises when you move. And it has a very strange fit. It's like wearing a crinkly plastic bag. With Venture 2 when you first step outside you are way too cold, because the jacket has zero insulation. But if you exert yourself at all it quickly gets hot and humid inside. I don't understand how you could take such a comfortable, breathable jacket and screw it up so badly. Perhaps Venture 2 is better in a complete downpour?\", 'I did not buy this from Amazon, I got it from a big box outdoor store. However I wanted to add a few comments. First the different colors come in different finishes and thicknesses. The solid colors like the asphalt grey I bought comes in a 70d ripstop. Thicker, stiffer etc. The black and dual color versions are in 40d ripstop. A little thinner, softer, more packable. Not better, just a different feel and finish. I personally like the thicker feel of the 70d.\\n\\nI also want to note that this jacket runs a little big. I am 6ft 230lbs 44 chest 38 waist and I fit a medium. Large was swimming on me. Just keep that in mind.', 'Great budget rain jacket/outer shell coat.\\nI\\'m 220 and 6\\'1\", medium build, and the XL fits perfectly - not too baggy when worn alone for warmer weather rain protection, yet roomy enough to be able to wear a layer or two underneath when things get frigid.\\nWorks great as a windproof shell with a hoodie and/or my down Spyder jacket for all but the coldest days.\\nGood breathability, with pit flaps to help regulate the temp.\\nGenerous sleeve length is a plus if you have longer arms like me. Decent hood thats big enough to accomodate most any headgear although perhaps not big enough for a helmet.

I can say that I was a little disappointed with the color I chose Tnf Dark Grey Heather because the picture on Amazon shows the Tnf Dark Grey Heather lining as Dark Grey/Black but when I received mine the interior lining is bright white. I actually chose this one because of the comments someone else made about the TNF Black having a bright white interior.

I was wearing the first one 2 years ago while walking in my town, and I was hit by a pickup truck that didn't see me - throwing me 20 feet. The jacket wasn't harmed at all (I wasn't so lucky). Sadly, I lost the jacket early this year, so immediately bought another one. Light, durable, comfortable, warm and waterproof! Oh, and large pockets!\", 'Very comfortable', 'Solid look, feel, and fit. M 150lbs ordered medium.', 'crinkly waterproof, comfy the navy is cool and dark shade of blue I really love it. Not too hot and good for layering.\\n.', 'No llegó la bolsa para guardarla.', 'North Face had excellent design features. I bought this jacket for frequent rain showers in the Pacific Northwest, yet it is light weight for spring and summer weather...\\n\\nNote that North Face branded products (if covered by warranty) fails due to a manufacturing defect they will repair it without charge, or replace it, at their discretion.', 'All raincoats look the same. I bought this one because it looked like more of a slim fit than its\\' Columbia counterpart, but really, they\\'re all baggy. Don\\'t tell me they\\'re designed to be your 4th layer. That\\'s bulls###. If I want baggy clothes, I\\'ll buy a size larger. The sleeves are also REALLY long.\\nI am 5\\'5\" 140lbs and bought the X-small. It works well for its designed purpose, but I still hate it.', 'This is a great rain jacket that is lightweight and stuffs easily into the hood. The jacket fit according to the sizing information and keeps the water out very well The item came in very fast and in very good shape.', 'High quality and dry', 'I ordered a medium and it looks like a large. Normally I wear medium jackets just fine, but this was too big. I have average sized length arms and the sleeves went over my entire hands. Quality is good overall.\\n\\nOrder 1 size down.', 'This lightweight rain jacket is perfect for my trips to Costa Rica. I bought it for our April trip which we are not taking as CR is closed to tourism during Covid 19. Damn. I have worn the previous one during torrential rainy season rain and never got wet.', 'Husband is 6’3”, 200lbs, slim build, has an XL. Loves this jacket. Says it doesn’t make him feel swampy when it’s gets humid after the rain it was protecting him from. He has a long torso so this hits him slightly higher than someone who is 6’ or less. The North Face really nailed this one!', 'Other reviews indicated that the size on this jacket ran large. The fit for me was appropriate and as indicated.\\nThis jacket is a good outer layer for the wind and rain.', \"Purchased this jacket for a future trip. It is very lightweight, which I wanted, sheds rain, and has the vented arm pit zippers. Haven't worn it yet so hope it lives up to expectations.\", 'Needed it for overseas trip with rain expected while touring, Prime two day shipping rocks. Nice sturdy jacket, waterproof and wind proof. Best part is it stores in its own pocket, great for packing. It did run big for the size, but it works out since you can wear layers underneath.', 'Be aware, this jacket runs large. I ordered a 2x for layering room, but 1x would be fine. The hood is massive! It completely covers your head including your face. Not very useable.', 'Great quality jacket. Grey color is slightly darker than images, which is preferable. The jackets has a generous fit allowing for layering if needed.\\n\\nHave not used it on a rainy day yet; however, I am confident it will do its job. Will update the review if needed.', 'This jacket is great! It is literally a water proof shell and thats it but does a great job of keeping you dry. I am 6 feet 200 lbs, athletic build and the jacket fits well, especially in the chest and shoulder area. There is plenty of room to throw a layer on underneath. The sleaees are a little long but I think a medium would have been too small on me.', 'It keeps me dry. It does it’s job. 5 stars', \"Excellent rain jacket and wind breaker. Wear layers underneath if you want to be warmer and I ordered a size up to be able to do just that. Overall it does it's job very well and it's pretty good looking too.\", \"I had to send it back because it was HUGE. I usually wear a large or XL and since this is a waterproof over layer I ordered XL. It was like wearing a tent. It cost like $20 bucks just to ship it back. Its like a thin tarp. It might have fit if I ordered XS but I'm not paying anymore to ship I'll find something else\", 'I wish it was a thicker jacket despite that it’s a nice jacket', 'As advertised,', \"It's great how waterproof this is, looks good, and the convenience of storing itself in a pocket it's a plus. I used it in pouring rain and kept me dry, at least the upper part of myself. Planning on buying one for my girlfriend.\", 'Is a great jacket. Exactly what my son wanted', 'I was concerned about this product where there were so many comments regarding this jacket running SO large. I am 5/8 and 180# with broad shoulders -- this fit as I would expect any large to fit - just like my large Columbia rain jacket. Yes the arms are a little long but I always have that issue.', 'The picture and color are too different. The photo is shown like khaki, but it is actually navy color.']}\n",

This particular jacket feels like an inner tube. It's stiff, poorly insulated and has that shiny cheap rubbery look of a jacket cut out of an inner tube.

He loves black, wanted a jacket where our two dog's hair wouldn't always be all over it and that would be warm in all weather while not being bulky.\\n\\nThis jacket fit the bill. As soon as he pulled it out of the package, he was beaming from ear to ear. He put it on and didn't take it off until of course it made him way too hot. This is now his most favorite jacket. Best of all he says dog hair doesn't stick to it at all!\", 'So, I am in no way an expert at spotting fakes, but this has been my favorite jacket for a few years now, and I own 3. I received my jacket from \"right-price\", and I should have paid more attention that it was not coming from Amazon proper. I bought the jacket to replace a color I had recently lost. The jacket showed up shoved (not folded) in a bag stamped \"ready to ship.\" The jacket had no tags on it whatsoever, and felt considerably lighter than the other two I had. The material was thinner. I put the jacket on, and it was cut way too wide in the back, and felt nothing like the fit of the other two I have. I was surprised, having paid the full $159, that i would receive a possible fake. I ended up doing some research, and ended up purchasing from the actual TNF website (why not, I was paying full price). The second I touched the material and felt the weight of the jacket I knew I was right, and returned the \"right-price\" jacket. This is not a knock on Amazon, they are still by far my favorite online retailer...just a word of caution to potential buyers...if you have never had one of these jackets, it is worth your time to actually feel what a real one feels like (at a store or a friends jacket) before you purchase online.', 'Jacket held up for me through college and after for several years. The one complaint I have is the seams were not waterproofed. When It leaked it was bad. I went to college in area with a lot of rain and cold winters. When I discovered this waterproofed rhe seams with spray and it works perfectly. This jacket keeps me warm and dry.', \"The jacket is awesome and same as the picture - It's north face, so you can't go wrong with any of their products. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the jacket came unwrapped in a regular shipping envelope. No plastic overwrap of any kind on it, just the plastic envelope. Kinda disappointed in the shipping, but not the Jacket - My wife loves it and wears it every day.\", \"I have an old northface that my younger brother has started using and I decided it might be time to get a new one. Mine is a few years old and I'm not sure if TNF has changed the style and fabric they use but I simply didn't like the material. The style is very similar but the material is a little different. I would have liked to get one with the same material and fabric but I'm not sure if it's been discontinued? I'll be going out to the mall to see if I can find a better fit. Otherwise the jacket is a nice jacket, I just had higher expectation based on my previous jacket.\", \"This jacket is great quality, and is definitely very warm - of course it is, it's North Face! I bought this for my husband, and it fits slightly smaller than expected, but I believe it just this style - not the brand in general. However, it does work and he loves it! This seller shipped fast too! Very happy with our purchase!\", \"My wife has the women's version of this coat- comparative to this one, the inside is 'cheap', rather than padded and warm on the women's version. The size is larger than expected (I have other North Face gear, never needed to size down), and overall it just has a feel of a lower-quality product than I'm used to finding with North Face. Its a shame too, because North Face is a bit difficult to find in my area. Hopefully this isn't par-for-course for North Face now.\", 'This was a perfect replacement to my aging trusty North Face fleece. I wanted to give this type of jacket a try versus buying another fleece. Its perfect to break the chill on windy days but light enough to not worry about having to take it off every time I have to go into a store. It also makes for a good jacket to jog on the brisk cold mornings by keeping me warm but also allowing my breath comfortably. Best light jacket.\\n\\nThank you!', 'I was sad to see this jacket is not exactly like the one I bought in 2008. The velcro at the wrist cuff does not stay \"stuck\" well and is most the time flopping in the wind. It is also not the same design. Bad move to change this iconic jacket. Wish I could buy a new older version. I guess this is what happens when a company is bought out. The new owners have to mess up a great product!', \"Perfect for rainy autumn days. This jacket is completely waterproof. It's warmer than I expectd which is nice since I can wear a t-shirt or other such light layer underneath and still be comfortable. Velcro straps on the wrists are a dream come true. I have short arms so sleeves are always too long but with this jacket that's not a concern. Highly recommend for anyone who lives in a cold and rainy climate\", 'Exactly what we ordered & expected my husband is very pleased 😌', \"My husband had this coat for years and it finally started to wear down after wearing it while gutting and remodeling our house. I replaced it for him with this one and he was so excited. It's perfect. It lasts for years, is warm enough to be a winter coat but can also be worn in spring/fall, and it has great pockets. It also looks very sleek. Oh, and it is waterproof.\", 'Bought this for my son for Christmas. It fits him nicely and looks sharp.

He loved it!', \"I've had this jacket for a few years now and still love it. I've had no issues with durability. The chest pocket is great for storing my phone or ipod. Super comfortable lightweight jacket for wearing when it rains in the spring/fall and I even wear it when the temperature is in the 40's.\", 'I like the look and fit. However, it is not as warm as I had expected. I switched to this jacket from a like Under Armour jacket that was as light, but more wind resistant and warmer.', 'Great jacket. Exactly what you would expect from a North Face product. Water resistant and very warm for the thickness of jacket. Has become my favorite jacket. I would recommend this product with a second thought.', \"Very good coat that lasted me thru 2015 winter as expected. If its really cold, I put on a hoody for extra protection. It's windproof, but I wouldn't want to be caught in a fierce winter storm wearing only this. But in the early spring or late fall months, it's great.\", \"This jacket is a bit clammy feeling when I wear it. Also, while it fits nicely around the shoulders, it's quite loose around the waist... which allows the cold winter air to blow up into the jacket. Mind you, I'm not super-fit by any means - a 35 inch waist isn't exactly 'cut'. So if it's loose around a 35 inch waist... then it's probably around a 38-39 inch waist for the jacket.\", \"If I hadn't caught this product on sale I would return it because the zipper is for a left-handed person and I'm right-handed very disappointed but I can live with it since I got it for $100\", \"Bought this for my husband, who wears it every day. Provides mobility, I t's light yet keeps him warm, he doesn't need extra layers underneath. Also he's worn it in the rain and stayed dry. Definitely recommend this jacket, and it's reasonably priced.\", \"If all my jackets this one is by far my favorite. It keeps me warm when it's cold out and keeps me cool when I'm warmed up. This is I think an essential jacket to have in an area where you have many microclimates.\", 'Fits just right. The only thing I would like is if the North Face label was black and not grey. Otherwise all good.', \"A nice jacket, fit to size, and looks very sharp on, but I probably paid at least $20 to $30 dollars more than I should have once I looked around at other retailers....at Christmas time Cabela's had them on sale for $100.00. All in all though, great service and a great product. Thank you.\", \"Only draw back was the left sleeve adjustment, it won't stick to the velcro. Other than that it's perfect.

It is made of a durable fabric and has a nice size chest pocket so this is a formidable hiking jacket. The only gripe I have with it is the collar. The front of the collar is stiff and even when not fully zipped up, it stands up and rubs on my chin. My scruff catches it like velcro and has begun fraying the soft fabric on the inside of the collar. I find myself constantly trying to avoid rubbing it by looking up to go over the collar. It gets annoying. I've tried folding the collar down to make it stand out to the side but it doesn't work because it's mainly the zipper that is to blame for it standing up. I wish TNF would fix this. The heat transfer logos worried me but it's a little thicker than the ones they're putting on their stuff these days, which are like paper. I personally would prefer an embroidered logo for the price of these jackets. I feel like it's only a matter of time before the heat sealed logo starts to come off\", \"Was a hit as a Birthday present for my bf. He's always wanted one of these jackets. I've watched him window shop this thing for too long. Lol I was nervous about buying online b/c of sz & possible fakes. Idk the difference if it was fake but its nicely made & seems like the real deal to me. Thinking about buying one for my son for Christmas so yes I'd buy from this seller again. :) Bought my bf a L. He's 6ft & around 200lbs. Fit him nicely. My 14yr old son who is 5'8 & 165lbs it was a bit too big when he tried it on. Thinking he'll need a medium. Hope this helps somebody. Thanks for the jacket & fast shipping. We love it.\", 'Such a great jacket. I love wearing this on chilly nights when I walk my dog outside', \"I was able to pick this up on sale from AAFES post exchange for $44.99. I'm very happy! Durable, Light and warm. Excellent product.\", 'I don\\'t know what happened to North Face. Their cut and sizes are ridiculous. I am 6\\'4\" and 200 lbs, not fat, slender/athletic. Zero North Face clothing fits anymore, especially these jackets. In the past I have loved my NF gear, but lately the cut is terrible. The sleeves are too short, the torso too short, and way to much material in the body. Under the arms it bunches up. The bottom edge lets in wind, and if you use the drawstring to tighten up, its like a big puffball in the chest The whole jacket, it\\'s like a big boxy square. It\\'s 2015 NF, wake up. I tried the XL and XXL. The XXL was just massive in the body, with proper sleeve length for me though. I think I have a fairly common body type. More common than say, someone my height who is 300lbs, which is who the XXL will fit. The XL would fit someone like 6\" and 250lbs. Who do you think is buying this outdoor/activity gear, North Face? Mr. Couch Potato? Unless they make some drastic fit changes in the next year\\'s rollout, I am done with this company. It has all the feel of sellout company to me at this point, like they aren\\'t even trying.', 'This is a fake product!! Very high quality fake butnis not official North face. Zipper on wrong side tags not right and different fabric. Amazon needs to remove.', \"But this for my boyfriend to replace a lost north face jacket and he loves this one.

Quality, style and warmth! 12 stars!', 'Love it', 'Parfait.', 'Great jacket, professional look, durable.', \"I purchased this jacket prior to a trip to southern Chile. I wanted a softshell jacket that would keep the elements out and remains breathable while I go hiking around Patagonia. This jacket is not suitable for that purpose.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I really like this jacket. It is a great looking jacket. It fits well. Very warm and cozy. The wind in Southern Patagonia was up to 100 km/hr, and this jacket (on top of a base layer) kept the wind out and kept me warm while walking around town playing tourist. When I actually engaged in moderately strenuous activities like hiking through the hills and mountains of Chile, however, this jacket is not breathable enough and soon I was sweating in the inside, despite having only one base layer underneath. My phone which I often leave in the left pocket would be wet with condensed moisture inside the jacket.

I wear it regularly in cooler weather while traveling to work and running errands. It's very nice for a stroll through the park or sitting in a bar drinking beer. It's a nice jacket to wear at the office to let people know that you like the idea of the North Face and the idea of the outdoors and that on the weekend you think that you could climb a mountain.

This particular jacket feels like an inner tube. It's stiff, poorly insulated and has that shiny cheap rubbery look of a jacket cut out of an inner tube. Awful\", \"This was a Christmas gift for my husband after he kept hinting about a North Face jacket this past year. He loves black, wanted a jacket where our two dog's hair wouldn't always be all over it and that would be warm in all weather while not being bulky.\\n\\nThis jacket fit the bill. As soon as he pulled it out of the package, he was beaming from ear to ear. He put it on and didn't take it off until of course it made him way too hot. This is now his most favorite jacket. Best of all he says dog hair doesn't stick to it at all!\", 'So, I am in no way an expert at spotting fakes, but this has been my favorite jacket for a few years now, and I own 3. I received my jacket from \"right-price\", and I should have paid more attention that it was not coming from Amazon proper. I bought the jacket to replace a color I had recently lost. The jacket showed up shoved (not folded) in a bag stamped \"ready to ship.\" The jacket had no tags on it whatsoever, and felt considerably lighter than the other two I had. The material was thinner. I put the jacket on, and it was cut way too wide in the back, and felt nothing like the fit of the other two I have. I was surprised, having paid the full $159, that i would receive a possible fake. I ended up doing some research, and ended up purchasing from the actual TNF website (why not, I was paying full price). The second I touched the material and felt the weight of the jacket I knew I was right, and returned the \"right-price\" jacket. This is not a knock on Amazon, they are still by far my favorite online retailer...just a word of caution to potential buyers...if you have never had one of these jackets, it is worth your time to actually feel what a real one feels like (at a store or a friends jacket) before you purchase online.', 'Jacket held up for me through college and after for several years. The one complaint I have is the seams were not waterproofed. When It leaked it was bad. I went to college in area with a lot of rain and cold winters. When I discovered this waterproofed rhe seams with spray and it works perfectly. This jacket keeps me warm and dry.', \"The jacket is awesome and same as the picture - It's north face, so you can't go wrong with any of their products. The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is that the jacket came unwrapped in a regular shipping envelope. No plastic overwrap of any kind on it, just the plastic envelope. Kinda disappointed in the shipping, but not the Jacket - My wife loves it and wears it every day.\", \"I have an old northface that my younger brother has started using and I decided it might be time to get a new one. Mine is a few years old and I'm not sure if TNF has changed the style and fabric they use but I simply didn't like the material. The style is very similar but the material is a little different. I would have liked to get one with the same material and fabric but I'm not sure if it's been discontinued? I'll be going out to the mall to see if I can find a better fit. Otherwise the jacket is a nice jacket, I just had higher expectation based on my previous jacket.\", \"This jacket is great quality, and is definitely very warm - of course it is, it's North Face! I bought this for my husband, and it fits slightly smaller than expected, but I believe it just this style - not the brand in general. However, it does work and he loves it! This seller shipped fast too! Very happy with our purchase!\", \"My wife has the women's version of this coat- comparative to this one, the inside is 'cheap', rather than padded and warm on the women's version. The size is larger than expected (I have other North Face gear, never needed to size down), and overall it just has a feel of a lower-quality product than I'm used to finding with North Face. Its a shame too, because North Face is a bit difficult to find in my area. Hopefully this isn't par-for-course for North Face now.\", 'This was a perfect replacement to my aging trusty North Face fleece. I wanted to give this type of jacket a try versus buying another fleece. Its perfect to break the chill on windy days but light enough to not worry about having to take it off every time I have to go into a store. It also makes for a good jacket to jog on the brisk cold mornings by keeping me warm but also allowing my breath comfortably. Best light jacket.\\n\\nThank you!', 'I was sad to see this jacket is not exactly like the one I bought in 2008. The velcro at the wrist cuff does not stay \"stuck\" well and is most the time flopping in the wind. It is also not the same design. Bad move to change this iconic jacket. Wish I could buy a new older version. I guess this is what happens when a company is bought out. The new owners have to mess up a great product!', \"Perfect for rainy autumn days. This jacket is completely waterproof. It's warmer than I expectd which is nice since I can wear a t-shirt or other such light layer underneath and still be comfortable. Velcro straps on the wrists are a dream come true. I have short arms so sleeves are always too long but with this jacket that's not a concern. Highly recommend for anyone who lives in a cold and rainy climate\", 'Exactly what we ordered & expected my husband is very pleased 😌', \"My husband had this coat for years and it finally started to wear down after wearing it while gutting and remodeling our house. I replaced it for him with this one and he was so excited. It's perfect. It lasts for years, is warm enough to be a winter coat but can also be worn in spring/fall, and it has great pockets. It also looks very sleek. Oh, and it is waterproof.\", 'Bought this for my son for Christmas. It fits him nicely and looks sharp. Still unsure of the warmth; however, we have had bitter cold, below zero weather here. He has a warm layer underneath it if he is going to be outside for a long time.', 'Bought this as a work jacket for my husband. He loved it!', \"I've had this jacket for a few years now and still love it. I've had no issues with durability. The chest pocket is great for storing my phone or ipod. Super comfortable lightweight jacket for wearing when it rains in the spring/fall and I even wear it when the temperature is in the 40's.\", 'I like the look and fit. However, it is not as warm as I had expected. I switched to this jacket from a like Under Armour jacket that was as light, but more wind resistant and warmer.', 'Great jacket. Exactly what you would expect from a North Face product. Water resistant and very warm for the thickness of jacket. Has become my favorite jacket. I would recommend this product with a second thought.', \"Very good coat that lasted me thru 2015 winter as expected. If its really cold, I put on a hoody for extra protection. It's windproof, but I wouldn't want to be caught in a fierce winter storm wearing only this. But in the early spring or late fall months, it's great.\", \"This jacket is a bit clammy feeling when I wear it. Also, while it fits nicely around the shoulders, it's quite loose around the waist... which allows the cold winter air to blow up into the jacket. Mind you, I'm not super-fit by any means - a 35 inch waist isn't exactly 'cut'. So if it's loose around a 35 inch waist... then it's probably around a 38-39 inch waist for the jacket.\", \"If I hadn't caught this product on sale I would return it because the zipper is for a left-handed person and I'm right-handed very disappointed but I can live with it since I got it for $100\", \"Bought this for my husband, who wears it every day. Provides mobility, I t's light yet keeps him warm, he doesn't need extra layers underneath. Also he's worn it in the rain and stayed dry. Definitely recommend this jacket, and it's reasonably priced.\", \"If all my jackets this one is by far my favorite. It keeps me warm when it's cold out and keeps me cool when I'm warmed up. This is I think an essential jacket to have in an area where you have many microclimates.\", 'Fits just right. The only thing I would like is if the North Face label was black and not grey. Otherwise all good.', \"A nice jacket, fit to size, and looks very sharp on, but I probably paid at least $20 to $30 dollars more than I should have once I looked around at other retailers....at Christmas time Cabela's had them on sale for $100.00. All in all though, great service and a great product. Thank you.\", \"Only draw back was the left sleeve adjustment, it won't stick to the velcro. Other than that it's perfect.

I eventually ended-up buying one of each: one Columbia and one North Face Canyonlands Full-Zip. Both are excellent products but they are slightly different:\\n- The North Face Canyonlands is a little bit thicker and warmer than the columbia (just a little bit). The columbia is more of a mid-season product that could even be used in a cold summer day/morning. The Northface is more of a \"wintry season\" product, I imagine I would sweat inside the car when driving while using it.\\n- Hands down, the North Face has a better fit, say a \"contoured fit\" that follows the lines of your body. The Columbia has a good fit too, but it feels slightly baggy.\\n- The columbia has the thumb whole in the sleeve. Even though the columbia feels slightly baggy (it\\'s not), it is actually more comfortable for hiking/jogging than the North Face. You want your clothes to feel packed to your torso and arms, and want to avoid relative movement of your sleeves with respect to your arms when hiking. Let\\'s simply say: the columbia is more \"sporty or fitness-oriented\" than the northface.\\n\\nI hope this helps take a decision.\\n\\nBest,', 'Temp in winter here are 64 in mornings, 70 daytime - breezes, both cool & warm, cloudy days and we need this type of cover.

These would be alleviated if they used the same elastic that they used on the back of the slipper for the top. It's definitely a design flaw to not accommodate different sized feet, especially since these already run small. With the size 12 (already a half size up), I would end up with lines across the top of my feet after wearing these because they were so tight. With some elastic, the size 12 probably would've been fine, but I had to go up another full size for my foot to comfortably fit.\\n\\nThese also have an annoying 'THERMOBALL' tag on the inside of the slipper.

They’re warm, comfortable and I love the fact they have bottoms on them that I can walk outside if I have to take the trash out, etc. 100% good quality and worth the money for sure.', 'Was very hopeful with the purchase, however, I was unfortunately disappointed.

I was recently looking for a warm and comfy shoe to wear in the winter motnhs, and by golly did I find what I was after. These shoes are not only warm, and comfy, but they are stylish. I routinely get compliments on them when out and about. Let me also take a second and talk about the slipper conversion, these shoes are a life saver when the dog needs to go out and it 30 degrees or less outside.

Great buy!', \"First impressions,kinda heavy. Together they weigh 1 pound. After putting them on however, my thoughts about weight slowly withered away as my feet fell into a sublime comfort I haven't felt in a shoe.

Something in the upper part make it difficult to put them on.\\nOnce you made it, they are comfortable and light', 'While the color is very attractive and they are soft, but I am disappointed pointed with how they fit compared to the traction mule 4’s. I’m also dissatisfied with the way the outer stitching appears compared to the 4’s. The way the 4’s are stitched bends more naturally with the foot. These bend with a more “blocky, bulky” like feel. I LOVE the Thermoball Traction Mule 4’s (they are the black pair with grey triangles in my photo), but these are the Traction Mule 5’s (the grey pair in the photo). I was excited as I thought the 5’s would be a newer version of the 4’s. Yet the 5’s are pointier, more narrow and are much tighter around the ankle than the 5’s. And this is coming from someone with a relatively small and average width foot. I bought size 8 and while the length is good, they are pointy and narrow so purchasing a 9 would make them too long for my foot. All in all they are less attractive due to the pointiness and more importantly, less comfortable than I had expected. I’m very disappointed as the traction mule 4’s were my favorite slipper. I bought three of the 4’s I loved them so much. This will be the only pair of the 5’s I buy. Honestly, I don’t see how some sellers can get away with charging over one hundred dollars... The comfort level of these I would value around $25 or maybe $30, an average sturdy house slipper that can be worn outside, at school or while around the campground.', 'I ordered these for my husband for our anniversary.

Very comfortable and warm, I’d highly recommend them if you’re looking for a shoe that’s visibly unique.', 'These appear to be great shoes but we ordered a half size larger than my husband wears and because he has a high instep, they were still too tight across the top of his foot.

The material is thin, so if you get it caught on anything sharp it can tear. I’ve had mine for a good while now, and there are two small tears, but no filling coming out. This is somewhat expected, they are not meant for work or anything like that. Just a great pair of slippers to keep the feet warm.\\n\\nWarning: They do get warm! So if you sweat a lot naturally, might not be the best for you. I have to take them off periodically as they get toasty', 'I normally wear a size 10 and I had to order a size 11 to fit and even that is pretty snug. Just beware', 'The inserts are pretty hard, but these do keep your feet warm. So warm that your feet will sweat no matter the temperature.', 'Excellent fit, warm, sturdy construction, can wear in the snow.

He has worn these slippers daily for the past 7 months with the occasional wash and they still look fairly new.', 'Great quality. Looks and feels great. I had to buy size bigger than what I usually buy. Hard to put on because of design', 'Bought for my husband and he is very impressed. I bought a pair for myself last yr and think they are great! Good quality and light weight which is esp nice for travel.', 'The slippers are well made and look good, but the fit is rather tight.', 'Gift for my Husband, he loves them', \"Great slippers! I use them for errands around my apartment complex and taking my dog out. Just water resistant enough and with enough traction to be great for that. Wish I'd read the reviews, I got an 11 first and they were way too small—the ankles were so tight they cut off circulation. Returned them for a 12 and they fit perfectly.\", 'I’ve owned a handful of slippers are these are the best by a mile. They keep my feet warm without making them sweat. They are well built so they should last much longer than others I’ve owned. The bottoms are durable for use outside but I only use them indoors.', 'Ultra confort', 'Fits a little tighter than most slippers of a similar size. May be, in part, due to the elastic cuff on the heel. Other than the closer fit, extremely comfortable.', 'Had a pair of North Face down booties forty years ago. Nice and warm, but soft soles. I bought these specifically to keep my feet warm, they don’t do a good job at that. The soles are fine, they look good. They do not hold in warmth ant better than a good pair of socks. Not recommended.', 'If you wear a half size I would size up instead of down', 'These are so great for so many reasons. First off, these have come in great use for early morning/ late nights in the desert/camping. They are also great to wear just around the house. Super comfortable', \"I normally wear men size 12, I got size 12 of this slipper, but because of the design at the back its hard to put on the shoes.

Dope', 'Will use indoors and around deck only to avoid ripping cloth outer cover. Nice, cozy and warm.', 'He says they are so comfortable!', 'Exactly what I was looking for. Glad I went up a half size instead of down a half size.', 'Very comfy and great for camping.', \"The north face slippers are nice looking from the outside. The following are issues which negatively impact the product deficiencies.:\\n\\n1. Size is way off I wear a 10 and went up a size, and they were still too tight.\\n2. The upper lip folds in as you put them on, because the foot opening is a tight fit.\\n3. The hard outsole is so hard, that they are like walking on hard wood floors even outside.\\n4. The cushion is a poor quality.\\n\\nLately several orders from amazon have not reflected the description as written on the product which leaves me to believe, that the items could be faulty in production for one reason or another, not damaged but faulty in sizing or product dimensions, and then trying to sell them on amazon. Be careful ordering if they do not allow returns don't buy.\", 'Really nice and very warm slippers.', 'Me gustaron mucho , solo que la suela es un poco delgada pero me encantaron', 'Very comfy. Good grippy sole. Marked it 4 star only for size issue. True size is a little snug. Would have ordered next size up.', 'Great for indoor as well as outdoor. Hurt my foot skateboarding. These have been the “Go To’s.”', 'Easy to wear, very soft and warm inside, lightweight and stylish. Perfect for late autumn and winter in Ukraine.', 'Slimmer design', \"These are not soft, fluffy, easy to slip into house shoes! They are like a sleeping bag for your feet. The opening is not large, you WILL have to use your hands to put these on, and they are not softly padded. But, if you are in a cool place, or have always cold feet, once you have these house shoes on, your feet will be warm. The insulation and close fit to your ankle hold in your body heat. I am 62, have had many house shoes, and none are half as warm as these. Putting them on is a little work, but then it's over, your feet will be warm! The sole under my foot felt too firm at first, but I got used to them and then it was fine, never uncomfortable, just different. These are for serious warmth, and ability to take short trips outside, not for slipping on without your hands.\", 'Great product', 'Its really nice and comfy', 'These Slippers are warm and reasonably comfortable.. The exterior seems great like they will hold up. The insoles are lined with a kinda cheap fake fur material that makes your feet sweat a little. The material under the insole appears to be made out of cardboard. So far they are comfy and warm, just not sure the materials and construction are worth the price..', 'Very comfortable and warm!', 'I’m wearing them right now. I love them and always have. I wore them in PB’s in Afghanistan, I wear them in NYC, which is probs more dangerous lol', 'They are great comfortable', 'Fair warning: I am wearing these around the house, not in the field.\\n\\nThese slippers are very comfortable and just warm enough to not make my feet sweat, which is a problem with other slippers. If I was using these for camping, they would probably not be warm enough for winter. The soles are awesome and should last for years. If you have average or wide feet, these might be tight.\\n\\nOverall, I’m very happy.', 'Warm but not hot and very comfortable', 'Very nice slip on for around the house or light outside errands', 'This is what my grandson wanted, do I’m assuming it’s a good product.', \"I'm glad I read the other comments before buying these. I normally wear a size 11 but I do have wide feet. I upped the size to 12 and they fit very well. Perfect actually. My only concern is if they are washable? We'll find out I guess.\", 'These shoes are comfortable to wear but have very poor traction on damp surfaces especially on moist ceramic tile.', 'When I first started wearing these I really liked them. Insole wore down quickly and feet would be drenched in sweat, choking for airflow of any kind. Work better in camping cold conditions at campsite. As at home slipper, way too hot. Such a bummer they can’t be washed either as I’m dying to freshen these up, get new insole, disinfect from all my sweat.', 'North face almost never lets me down. After a long day on the trail your feet will praise you for slipping into these. They are sturdy and well built and still make you feel as though you are walking on a cloud.', \"These slippers were a bit pricey being North Face, but slippers are hard to come by right now and I needed some. I wear 10.5, and these were 11, but they fit a little snug especially with socks. Still, I'm happy with them overall.\", 'This item is outstanding. It is everything I excepted and more. Sizing is ok. I wear 10 1/2 shoe and an 11 fit just fine. It is comfortable, warm, easy to put on. Great for around the house or to gym for yoga class. Would be excellent at a campsite slipper. Highly recommend this.', 'Very comfortable, I have used them for more than just slippers like walking around and they have held up great!', 'Not that comfy for the price they want. Material can rip easy.', \"Overall this is a good slipper. They are pretty comfortable and warm. I have high arches, and the elastic is pretty tight around the top of my foot - even leaving a line on the top of my foot after I wear them. I've had them for over a week now, and I just kept wearing them and they have gotten better (looser at the top) the more I wear them. I normally wear a 9.5 (42 EU size) and I got the size 9, and I think they fit well overall.\", 'Size up. I’m a size 9 women’s and I ordered my size and I will say my only complaint is around ankle is a little snug. I read the reviews but still ordered my size and I should have listened. A 10 would have worked for me. The slipper fits but around the ankle could be more comfortable if I sized up. Other than that I am very happy with the slippers overall!! They’re warm, comfortable and I love the fact they have bottoms on them that I can walk outside if I have to take the trash out, etc. 100% good quality and worth the money for sure.', 'Was very hopeful with the purchase, however, I was unfortunately disappointed. There is an “annoying” mid seam/stitch line that digs into the outside my foot - very uncomfortable. Two thumbs down!', \"I am a big face of The North Face. It's a brand I grew up with as my dad was an avid backpacker, and always made sure we had nice things to use when we were out too. I was recently looking for a warm and comfy shoe to wear in the winter motnhs, and by golly did I find what I was after. These shoes are not only warm, and comfy, but they are stylish. I routinely get compliments on them when out and about. Let me also take a second and talk about the slipper conversion, these shoes are a life saver when the dog needs to go out and it 30 degrees or less outside. Just crush the heel in slide these bad boys on and you are READY TO ROLL. TNF, you did it again. 10/10 would buy again.\", 'These will keep your feet toasty warm. They are true to size, regardless of what other nonsense people are posting here. Get the same size as the shoes you commonly wear. One small issue - they can be a bit tight across the top of your foot. Maybe they will stretch out, but I typically need to slip them off after an hour or two because of the pressure.', 'Extremely comfortable. I use them as house shoes but can be used as regular shoes.', \"*Update*\\nUnfortunately after less than a year (plus I don't wear these in warm months) they have torn without my involvement. They are nice but maybe not built to last very long 😔\\n\\nAs most people have said order a size up. I wear 10.5, ordered 11 and they fit well, just tight.\\n\\nOther than that they are very comfy and warm. The bottoms are always the thing I worry about most as the rubber has a tendency to break. I cant comment on that since these are so new. I like them though, they are nice. Right now if I had to replace these it would be with the same ones.\", \"Bought these for my partner and they were the closest match to slippers I got for him from Ll Bean which he had for years. They were getting worn out and they've since been discontinued. These are warmer and he's been wearing them every day since Christmas so I guess he really likes them.\", 'I saw these on a friend. He\\'s was actually coming in from upstate N.Y. to have Thanksgiving dinner with us, and then going back up. He said they were incredibly comfortable and he\\'s gone outside in some snow, around the cabin all day, driving for hours and loves them! Another buddy of mine has these horrible ripped up slippers that need a funeral, so I got these for him for Christmas (opened em up early). He loves em too! Hinting at the girlfriend for the camo ones for me! Another homerun from The Northface! (I have their expedition tents, sleeping bags, climbing jackets...Not the \"fashion\" end stuff and have alot of respect for it all!) These slippers look good, are warm, can stand outside wear...even street wear. Nice', \"I can't say enough about how great these are. Wear around the house and you can walk outside and grab the mail in them. I wear them when we have people over for game night and I get asked where did you get those all the time. I wear anywhere from an 11 to a 12 in shoes and I got a 12 and they fit perfect.. I highly recommend!\", 'I’m an 11 in other shoes so I ordered an 11 and this fit perfect. Nice and snug but with room to wiggle your toes. The inside sole is like memory foam. Super comfortable. A nice shoe to slip on to do minor chores (walk the dog, take out trash, etc). Great buy!', \"First impressions,kinda heavy. Together they weigh 1 pound. After putting them on however, my thoughts about weight slowly withered away as my feet fell into a sublime comfort I haven't felt in a shoe. Definitely the best camp shoe, warm,memory foam feeling, with a sole that's like tennis shoes. No problem walking around camps with sticks or Rocky surface.\", 'they are hard to fit in. Something in the upper part make it difficult to put them on.\\nOnce you made it, they are comfortable and light', 'While the color is very attractive and they are soft, but I am disappointed pointed with how they fit compared to the traction mule 4’s. I’m also dissatisfied with the way the outer stitching appears compared to the 4’s. The way the 4’s are stitched bends more naturally with the foot. These bend with a more “blocky, bulky” like feel. I LOVE the Thermoball Traction Mule 4’s (they are the black pair with grey triangles in my photo), but these are the Traction Mule 5’s (the grey pair in the photo). I was excited as I thought the 5’s would be a newer version of the 4’s. Yet the 5’s are pointier, more narrow and are much tighter around the ankle than the 5’s. And this is coming from someone with a relatively small and average width foot. I bought size 8 and while the length is good, they are pointy and narrow so purchasing a 9 would make them too long for my foot. All in all they are less attractive due to the pointiness and more importantly, less comfortable than I had expected. I’m very disappointed as the traction mule 4’s were my favorite slipper. I bought three of the 4’s I loved them so much. This will be the only pair of the 5’s I buy. Honestly, I don’t see how some sellers can get away with charging over one hundred dollars... The comfort level of these I would value around $25 or maybe $30, an average sturdy house slipper that can be worn outside, at school or while around the campground.', 'I ordered these for my husband for our anniversary. In A size 12.\\nHe absolutely loves them \\U0001faf6🏽', 'I was debating between these and another pair of slippers and glad I picked these. Felt a bit tight when I first put them on but within an hour they fit just fine. I haven’t worn them outside but they are solid enough to wear wherever you go. They are not the best looking slippers but also not bad, they look sporty. Overall they are pretty comfortable and extremely warm. If your feet get cold easy these will do the job of making them toasty.', \"I bought this same brand/style of slippers for my husband years ago, and they were starting to get ragged, so this pair was a replacement. After having many different slippers over the years, these were the only ones that he's ever been happy enough with to want to get the same ones again (yes, he is that picky about his slippers). He wears them daily in the winter since we don't wear shoes in the house.\", 'Great traction, Very warm and very comfortable but they fit small. I sized up and it fits my foot well but it’s still pretty tight at the top around my ankles, I had to take them off a couple times on the first day because they started to hurt. If you have wide feet, chunky feet or cankles, these probably aren’t for you.', 'Loved the color combination and they look great on my man....', 'These slippers are the best! I spent hours researching the best slippers that won’t bust my budget - and these are it.\\n\\nMy feet are sensitive to the cold after frostbite. Pair these slippers with warm socks and I can finally relax at night with my feet being warm.\\n\\nOne small note - the logo on the inside sole of the slipper comes off after a few wears. That’s the only shortcoming.', 'These North Face shoes remind me of the poofy jackets I grew up wearing when I was younger, so when I saw these I had to have them. Very comfortable and warm, I’d highly recommend them if you’re looking for a shoe that’s visibly unique.', 'These appear to be great shoes but we ordered a half size larger than my husband wears and because he has a high instep, they were still too tight across the top of his foot. There is no flexibility in the material across the top of the shoe. Was very disappointed as the shoes were well made and would have been warm to wear inside or outside.', 'Play Video\\n For use around the house, maybe if I’m running to grocery store or the dispensary I’d also wear them but not for all day outings. Even though I feel like with these you could because the bottoms are thick! Almost like a shoe! I’m super impressed with these ! 5 ⭐️ for sure!', 'Really Nice slippers and seem to be well made. They have food insulation and a flexible heel to help slip on more easily. They are a little snug for a true to size fit but not to the point wear they are unwearable. Overall I would probably order these again depending on how long they last.', \"I wear a size 12 shoe, I ordered the slippers in a Size 13/14. I couldn't get my foot in them. I'm Disabled with no vehicle and nobody to send them back for me. I'm thoroughly disgusted. DON'T SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT.\", 'I haven’t had a chance to test the waterproofing but it is light in weight', 'I was very much looking forward to this pair of slippers. They look great and I was certain that they would fit and feel as all of my The North Face footwear. As soon as the package arrived I couldn’t wait to put them on my very painful feet and legs due to venous ulcers on both. What a MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT! I ordered a size 10. I couldn’t even bring my toes in. That’s how small they were. The seller didn’t even offered me the possibility for an exchange! Instead, I was emailed a return label to to ship it back to them in order to be refunded.\\n\\nWell, I don’t have a printer and I’m nowhere near a UPS location. I had to ask a niece of mine who lives out of state to print it and mail it to me. Now, I am forced to bother someone else to take it to a UPS location! I’m extremely disappointed!', 'They look goofy. Your feet however, will be comforted in the grace, love, and most importantly, warmth, forever in the bosom of the foot-lord himself (hallelujah).', 'Picked these up as a \"shoe\" that I would wear out on lazy days, long car rides, etc. They are comfortable, but they do pinch a bit if you wear them as a non-slip on. I would recommend ordering a size up.', \"I've had many pair of slippers and they always end tearing appart, even expensive ones, but theese are fantastic, very durable, good looking, very comfortable. Theese are perfectly fine for going out, but i only use them at home. It is true, as other reviewers say, that the size comes a little small, so i want 1/2 size up and fit perfect.\"]}\n",

I have had this pair for almost exactly one year. They have not seen hard use. I submit the picture of the soles as proof. However these shoes/boots are not indicative of what I have come to expect from the North Face which professes to be a maker of sturdy out door wear. I am a retired infantryman and I know my hiking boots. I however have not even used these to hike as I have my old pair which are low cut for that, I purchased these because when I retire my old ines and buy another , I wanted more ankle support. What you see in picture of the top is a result of just walking. Normal wear nothing extraneous as this is my “nice pair” for outings. The Mesh or webbing or whatever it is on the tops of both toe areas is disintegrating. I have spilled nothing on them nor put them in a washing machine or subjected them to high heat. They have not been snagged on anything like vegitation, the mesh is just coming apart like paper. This is just from normal flexing of my feet as I walk. I havent even run in them. I am truly disappointed in the product and this is a shame as they were my new favorite type to buy with the great comfort level and I love Vibram soles.', 'This is my fourth pair of North Face boots, about one new pair a year, all Hedgehog models. The first three all had 14 eyelets but the new version only has 10. The reduced number of eyelets makes the boot feel real loose, no matter how tight you think you have it. The material that covers the toe area on top was also reduced. The boot is now more expensive with less material creating a bad fit. What a shame as I know North Face will do nothing about this (insert super long rant here).', 'I love these!\\nThey look great, feel comfortable, sturdy, and lightweight.\\nI am not a weekend warrior who climbs 14ers on the weekends. (although I would love to at some point)\\nBut I am in the mountains a lot and love hiking 5 miles trails.

The quality of these boots is remarkable. Keeps my feet dry and comfortable. [Update 2023] as you can see from the photos that after a few months, they are falling apart at the top of the toe area. I’ve only walked on flat hard surfaces and they have been stored indoors and out of direct sunlight.

On day 2 there, I wore these on a 10 mile, fairly strenuous hike with a 2000 foot elevation change. These boots were the best I've used for this type of activity. Light and comfortable, along with waterproof as there were streams to navigate over.. I'd recommend them!\", 'Have only had them a bit over 2 weeks, but they stood up to a number of very wet days in Alaska.

The inside liner in the heels started wearing out very soon after I got them and they got small tears at the flex points in the front. They were 11 1/2's (my normal size) but they were a little bit tight. I don't usually have trouble with shoes fitting and as I don't wear them very often it wasn't that big a deal. I said I would not have another pair of North Face - but guess what, I do. I tried a pair of Merrills but had to return them because the fit was just not right for my foot. This time, I bought both an 11 1/2 and a 12 in the Ultra 111 to see which one was better. I wish I could say one of them was perfect but I must be in between because the 11 1/2 was slight short again and the 12 is just a little large. Either would have been vastly better than the Merrills so I am keeping the 12's. I have worn them a few times to break them in and so far I like them. Too early to tell whether theses will wear any better than the 109's did (not betting on it) so I am keeping the review at 3 stars.\", \"I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised about how good these shoes are. I had a pair of vibrams that were getting very very old and when I got these, I thought they were flimsy. Them I walked around in short socks in 35 degree weather for some time and my feet felt like they were in an oven. An oven is dry mind you. So they work as advertised. Let's see if they last!\", \"It's the best option for couples gift. Thank you\", \"North Face's Ultra 111 is such a hands down winner in the trail shoe arena that I now own two pair. Every person interested in the hiking domain must understand the need to take care of one's feet. The North Face Ultra 111 is the carefully crafted shoe that wraps around your foot and provides the highest level of comfort and protection from the elements that a shoe can offer. North Face's Ultra 111 is a highly versitile show that I can wear out on the trails, walking paths, or even transition and wear them in an office environment due to the shoe's carefully crafted design. This shoe offers the owner an all around solution no matter the environment one chooses. From my perspective the performance of the North Face Ultra 111 is unequalled and thus I now own two pair. Versatility, comfort, and durability all equal an outstanding shoe for those seeking a shoe for all occasions and situations one may encounter wheather in the outdoors or in the office. A superior performance by an outstanding piece of kit.\", 'I bought these mainly for fall hikes. I ordered my normal size and they were a little tight right out of the box, but loosened up with use and fit perfectly now. My first real test of them was a day spent hiking in northern Michigan. The temperature was in the lower 50s, and there was occasional light rain. My feet were very comfortable in these shoes all day. Never got wet and stayed warm. Happy with this purchase.', 'Well made shoe', 'The shoe fit exactly as I expected. Order extra 11.5 and they fit great. Super warm & great for wearing in Montana winters.', 'I bought these shoes for my husband. He uses them to do lawn work outside. This is his second pair.\\nThey last him about a year and he is hard on his shoes. They last well.', 'IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A TACTICAL SHOE, THIS IS THE ONE!!!!!!', 'The shoe it’s everything it said and more. Just get better insoles.', 'Exactly as expected.', 'Great product', 'Bought it to replace my old 110. Most noticeable change is the lace. The old lace was not round but was better textured and had better bite when tied. The waterproofing material also changed from Gortex to their own proprietary material. Seems to make no difference.

They're pretty burly, but still light and work great for running, especially through trails or grass. I’ve worn them a full downpour when everything else I was wearing was soaking wet except for my socks because of these shoes. The tread has some serious grip which makes walking up wet grassy and muddy hills no problem. If your doing 75 Hard its nice to have a waterproof shoe for that mandatory outdoor workout!

The inside liner in the heels started wearing out very soon after I got them and they got small tears at the flex points in the front. They were 11 1/2's (my normal size) but they were a little bit tight. I don't usually have trouble with shoes fitting and as I don't wear them very often it wasn't that big a deal. I said I would not have another pair of North Face - but guess what, I do. I tried a pair of Merrills but had to return them because the fit was just not right for my foot. This time, I bought both an 11 1/2 and a 12 in the Ultra 111 to see which one was better. I wish I could say one of them was perfect but I must be in between because the 11 1/2 was slight short again and the 12 is just a little large. Either would have been vastly better than the Merrills so I am keeping the 12's. I have worn them a few times to break them in and so far I like them. Too early to tell whether theses will wear any better than the 109's did (not betting on it) so I am keeping the review at 3 stars.\", \"I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised about how good these shoes are. I had a pair of vibrams that were getting very very old and when I got these, I thought they were flimsy.

Let's see if they last!\", \"It's the best option for couples gift. Thank you\", \"North Face's Ultra 111 is such a hands down winner in the trail shoe arena that I now own two pair. Every person interested in the hiking domain must understand the need to take care of one's feet. The North Face Ultra 111 is the carefully crafted shoe that wraps around your foot and provides the highest level of comfort and protection from the elements that a shoe can offer. North Face's Ultra 111 is a highly versitile show that I can wear out on the trails, walking paths, or even transition and wear them in an office environment due to the shoe's carefully crafted design. This shoe offers the owner an all around solution no matter the environment one chooses. From my perspective the performance of the North Face Ultra 111 is unequalled and thus I now own two pair. Versatility, comfort, and durability all equal an outstanding shoe for those seeking a shoe for all occasions and situations one may encounter wheather in the outdoors or in the office. A superior performance by an outstanding piece of kit.\", 'I bought these mainly for fall hikes. I ordered my normal size and they were a little tight right out of the box, but loosened up with use and fit perfectly now. My first real test of them was a day spent hiking in northern Michigan.

I buy gear and don't buy fashion accessories. I only have on TNF item, an older pair of pants from their Summit Series which has held up well and delivered, but I stay away from TNF because it's just become a logo for a lot of people and I don't think their stuff is 'gear-oriented' any more. That said, I liked the look of the Salty Dog Beanie, and how it was made, so I took a shot. I did get the previous year version which has a very small, indiscreet logo. A departure from TNF and one I liked. Seems like they're out now. A drag because I REALLY like the beanie and wanted to buy another. But not for 45 bucks.\\n\\nWhen I first got it I almost thought they sent me a kids version. There's an inner lining that made it feel so tight that I almost returned it. But I gave it a few days of pretty constant wearing and I ended up with a perfect fit. It's cuffed but the lining doesn't prohibit how thick or thin you can cuff. You could also wear it uncuffed if you want something more towards the slouchy.\\n\\nI find it to be really well-made and delivers solid warmth. Just standing around in the teens with it has kept my head warm. Where there are some limitations is with hiking. I think that's really dependent on weather and how much someone sweats. The lining is a thin cotton but that means it'll hold sweat and that turns in to cold. The coldest I've hiked with it, because I wanted to check it out, was in the mid 20's and the sweat did become a little problematic. So this won't be my choice if it's cold and I'm working. But in warmer temps, or colder if you're not active, this is surprisingly solid choice. It is pilling a bit but I think it actually looks a little better with some wear.\\n\\nNow I need to find an outlet that has the older model. There's some other TNF stuff I'd consider but I'll never be a walking billboard for a company. TNF decided to move from gear to lifestyle. Their choice but I don't know too many dirt bags, other than Alex Honnold who is a paid athlete, who would go with them as a first choice. But they DID nail this beanie.\", 'I wasn’t expecting this hat to be so tight.

Either way, the hat is super cute and I would recommend cause it goes with all my winter outfits and the inside it super warm making it very insulated, just bummed about the logo.', 'Great beanie, but runs extremely small.', 'Way too small', 'Run small for a kid not an adult unless you have a small head', 'Keep you warm on the cold weather', \"I like this product bcuz it's warm, yarn is thick and was a perfect fit.\", \"It's a little too heavy for this part of the country, however it would be perfect for the Midwest\", 'Ottimo', 'This is a very nice beanie, warm and well lined, but as someone with a larger head, I found the ‘One Size Fits All’ to be a little small for my tastes.\\n\\nI prefer to wear the beanie low, covering most of my ears, whereas this one tends to slip up to a higher resting position over time, which can be annoying in particularly cold or windy weather.\\n\\nThat being said, it looks great and is perfectly ok for use in milder weather, and those with a more ‘regular’ sized head will probably find it perfectly adequate all round.', \"Ordered this for my 14 year old daughter.

Her doctor told her to stay away from the sun but my sister in law doesn’t drive and mostly walks everywhere so to help her we bought this for her to protect herself from the sun on her short walks. She used an umbrella as well but she says that this provided the protection she needed for areas ((neck) that would otherwise be exposed to the sun. Great product and great price.', \"Attractive hat but too small. Can't adjust. What a waste of time and money. I am a big fan of North Face but this hat is a big disappointment.\", \"I needed a new hat to wear SUP'ing or when I was out in the sun for awhile. I love this ballcap design with neck protection. The neck strap with a toggle and adjustable back strap are a nice touch. Its super lightweight too.\", 'My son loves it and wears it to scout camp']}\n",
